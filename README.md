# Elevvo Pathways Tasks 🚀

This repository holds three machine learning projects completed during the Elevvo Pathways Internship (Machine Learning track). They cover **regression**, **classification**, and **clustering** — each illustrating the ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📂 Project Overview

| Task | Title | Method | Key Results |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Task 1 | Student Score Prediction | Linear Regression | R² = 0.99, MAE = 0.27 |
| Task 2 | Customer Segmentation | K-Means Clustering | Silhouette Score = 0.56 |
| Task 4 | Loan Approval Prediction | Logistic Regression | Accuracy = 0.96, F1-score = 0.97 |

Each folder contains a notebook/script with the full workflow and visuals.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open the desired task folder  
3. Install requirements if needed  
4. Run the notebook or script to reproduce results  

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is a record of my internship at Elevvo pathways work and a practical reference for applying core ML techniques, from data preparation to evaluation and visualization.
