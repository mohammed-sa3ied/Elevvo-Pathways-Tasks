# Elevvo-Pathways-Tasks
This repository contains three machine learning tasks completed for the Elevvo Pathways Internship, covering regression, classification, and clustering. It showcases core ML steps including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Elevvo Pathways Tasks üöÄ

This repository holds three machine learning projects completed during the Elevvo Pathways Internship (Machine Learning track). They cover **regression**, **classification**, and **clustering** ‚Äî each illustrating the full ML workflow: data ingesting & cleaning, model building & tuning, and results visualization & evaluation.

## üìÇ Project Structure

| Task | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Task 1 | Student Score Prediction | A regression model to predict scores given input features |
| Task 2 | Customer Segmentation | A clustering project to group customers by behavior or features |
| Task 3 | Loan Approval Prediction | A classification model to predict whether a loan is approved |

Inside each task folder you'll find:
- A Jupyter Notebook (or scripts) walking through the process  
- Data files (if included)  
- Visualizations, plots, metrics, and explanations  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Clone this repo  
2. Navigate to the task folder you want  
3. Install dependencies (e.g. via `requirements.txt`)  
4. Run the notebook or script from start to finish  
5. Inspect results, visuals, and comments to understand the approach  

## üéØ Purpose & Highlights

This repo is both a record of my work during the internship and a hands-on reference for applying core machine learning techniques. It demonstrates how to:
- Prepare and preprocess datasets  
- Train and tune models  
- Evaluate performance using various metrics  
- Visualize predictions, errors, and clusters
